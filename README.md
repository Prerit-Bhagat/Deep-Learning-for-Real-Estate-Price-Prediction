# Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction
## **1. METHODOLOGY**

## **2. Overview**
This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict real estate prices based on a variety of features. The model explores the impact of feature engineering by progressively increasing the number of independent variables and evaluating their effects on prediction accuracy.
